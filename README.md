# GOakflat
## OakFlat simulation
PWR Simulation in Go

### Why?
This is all so that I can teach myself Go. It is based on the http://gamtech.com/oakflat.aspx that I used to enjoy playing in my youth (NERD lol).


ToDo
* Everything lol
    * Basic mechanics

            * Towers (with and without fan)
            * Heat Exchanger
    * Interface
        * Show stats
        * Input controls
